## What is Rollux?

[Rollux](https://rollux.com), built by [SYS Labs](https://syslabs.com), is a project dedicated to scaling blockchain technology and expanding its ability to coordinate people from across the world to build effective decentralized economies and governance systems. More specifically, Rollux is the EVM-equivalent Layer 2 optimistic rollup that introduces some key scaling technologies and security characteristics to Optimism's [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io). Built on [Syscoin's](https://syscoin.org) holistically modular Layer 1, Rollux inherits the security of Bitcoinâ€™s mining network through merged-mining, combined with decentralized multi-quorum finality. Rollux fully factors Syscoin's efficient data availability (Proof of Data Availability - PoDA) and data fee market rather than relying on EVM calldata or danksharding. Rollux is secure, scalable, and offers very low fees. Additionally, Rollux provides native Layer 2 data availability which makes it ideal for supporting Layer 3 and fractal scaling.

In all, Rollux is a unique and powerful alternative to other rollup-based stacks and blockchain scaling technologies in general.

In this repository, you'll find numerous core components of Rollux, the decentralized software stack maintained by SYS Labs, and much of the upstream [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io) which is maintained by the Optimism Collective. We encourage you to explore, modify, extend, and test the code as needed. By collaborating on free, open software and shared standards, SYS Labs, Syscoin Foundation and the Optimism Collective aim to prevent siloed software development and rapidly accelerate the development of blockchain ecosystems. Come contribute, build the future, and redefine power, together.

**NOTE: It is important to understand that this repository became public relatively recently. As such, some READMEs might be incomplete. We appreciate your patience while we work quickly to expand technical information about Rollux and refactor existing content!

Typo fixes are welcome; however, please create a single commit with all of the typo fixes & batch as many fixes together in a PR as possible. Spammy PRs will be closed.

## Security Policy and Vulnerability Reporting

If you are reporting any vulnerabilites exclusive to the Rollux codebase, you should follow the common sense "How to" guidelines echoed in Optimism's canonical [Security Policy](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
Bounty hunters are encouraged to check out [the Optimism Immunefi bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/).
While this does not apply to any Rollux-specific discoveries, the Optimism Immunefi program offers up to $2,000,042 for in-scope critical vulnerabilities in the Optimism codebase.
For vulnerabilities in any Rollux or SYS Labs websites, email servers or other non-critical infrastructure, please email SYS Labs at contact@syslabs.com. We appreciate detailed instructions for confirming the vulnerability.


## Bedrock-based

Rollux is based upon Optimism Bedrock!
You can find detailed specifications for the Bedrock upgrade within the [specs folder](./specs) in this repository.

## Development and Release Process

### Overview

Please read this section carefully if you're planning to fork or make frequent PRs into this repository.

### Production Releases

Production releases are always tags, versioned as `<component-name>/v<semver>`.
For example, an `op-node` release might be versioned as `op-node/v1.1.2`, and  smart contract releases might be versioned as `op-contracts/v1.0.0`.
Release candidates are versioned in the format `op-node/v1.1.2-rc.1`.
We always start with `rc.1` rather than `rc`.

For contract releases, refer to the GitHub release notes for a given release which will list the specific contracts being released. Not all contracts are considered production ready within a release and many are under active development.

Tags of the form `v<semver>`, such as `v1.1.4`, indicate releases of all Go code only, and **DO NOT** include smart contracts.
This naming scheme is required by Golang.
In the above list, this means these `v<semver` releases contain all `op-*` components and exclude all `contracts-*` components.

`op-geth` embeds upstream gethâ€™s version inside its own version as follows: `vMAJOR.GETH_MAJOR GETH_MINOR GETH_PATCH.PATCH`.
Basically, gethâ€™s version is our minor version.
For example if geth is at `v1.12.0`, the corresponding op-geth version would be `v1.101200.0`.
Note that we pad out to three characters for the geth minor version and two characters for the geth patch version.
Since we cannot left-pad with zeroes, the geth major version is not padded.

See the [Node Software Releases](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/releases) page of the documentation for more information about releases for the latest node components.

The full set of components that have releases are:

- `ci-builder`
- `op-batcher`
- `op-contracts`
- `op-challenger`
- `op-node`
- `op-proposer`

All other components and packages should be considered development components only and do not have releases.

### Development branch

The primary development branch is [`develop`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/).
`develop` contains the most up-to-date software that remains backwards compatible with the latest experimental [network deployments](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/networks).
The primary development branch is [`develop`](https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux/tree/develop/).
`develop` contains the most up-to-date software that remains backwards compatible with the latest testnet [network deployments](https://rollux.com/developers/docs/useful-tools/networks/).
If you're making a backwards compatible change, please direct your pull request towards `develop`.

**Changes to contracts within `packages/contracts-bedrock/src` are usually NOT considered backwards compatible.**
Some exceptions to this rule exist for cases in which we absolutely must deploy some new contract after a tag has already been fully deployed.
If you're changing or adding a contract and you're unsure about which branch to make a PR into, default to using a feature branch.
Feature branches are typically used when there are conflicts between 2 projects touching the same code, to avoid conflicts from merging both into `develop`.
